# Welcome to the contents of my Raspberry Pi!

## What's on it now?
A test run of my CSSE 333 project (intro to databases). I have a bit of time to work over spring break, so I'm getting this project set up on the pi. Hopefully there will be a couple views up too, if I can get connected to the db server back on campus.

## What was on it before?
Ehhh... not much
